    <h1>Learning and Crafting, One Recipe, One Design (and Code) at a time! </h1>
    <br>
    <p>Welcome to the start of my journey to become a full stack developer. On this site I will share some of my coding
        progress, favorite crafts, books, music, recipes and personal insights </p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>My Journey</b></h3>

    <p>I never thought at the age of 57, I would be starting a new career within the Tech Community. I'm hoping that
        this website will inspire others to realize that it's never "too late" to pursure your goals and dreams.
        This site will be a space for me to document my growth, share some stories and maybe connect with others who
        share
        the same path</p>

    <h3><b>How it started</b></h3>
    <p>November of 2022, I was laid-off as an Administrative Assistant. I struggled with self-doubt
        and a lot of uncertainty during this time. In May of 2024 I was given the opportunity to participate in a 2 year
        program,
        <a href="https://www.onenorthend.com/the-matrix-code">The Matrix Code.</a>
    </p>

    <p>During my learning journey, I've encountered some challenges, such as adapting to a new way of thinking,
        an example of this would be when I would try to write the code without actually breaking down what was being
        asked instead of designing a solution first; grasping concepts such as methods/functions and objects; and
        debugging - trying to find errors can be frustrating, when you don't have the experience. Each challenge I
        faced eventually became a lesson and I'm excited about the progress I've made thus far. </p>

    <h3><b>What's next</b></h3>
    <p>My current focus right now is mastering HTML and CSS and working on this site. I'm looking forward to sharing my
        progress, projects and insights with you.</p>


    "Every failure is a win, because if you've learned from your failure, it has now become a lesson." </p>
