<h4><b><i>Favorite Authors & Books</i></b></h4>
<br>
Reading is relaxing and something I do when I need to wind down. Here are a few books I've read along with some authors I recommend.
1. Heidi, Author: Johanna Spyri - I read this book when I was 10.
2. To Kill a Mockingbied, Author: Harper Lee - This book was a mandatory read in grade 9 or 10.
3. Pride & Prejudice, Author: Jane Austen - This book is a bit challenging to read, but it is a good book.
4. In Death series - Author: JD Robb - These books are murder/mystery books. The author also writes romance novels under the pseudonym Nora Roberts.
5. Any Nora Roberts book is a good read. Here are a few of my favotie series that I've read:
    - Key Trilogy
    - The Guardians Trilogy
    - The Cousins O'Dwyer Trilogy
    - The Sign of Seven Trilogy
    - Three Sisters Trilogy
