Reading is relaxing and something I do when I need to wind down. Here are a few books I've read along with some authors I recommend.
<ol type="1">
<li>Heidi, Author: Johanna Spyri - I read this book when I was 10.</li>
<li>To Kill a Mockingbied, Author: Harper Lee - This book was a mandatory read in grade 9 or 10.</li> 
<li>Pride & Prejudice, Author: Jane Austen - This book is a bit challenging to read, but it is a good book./li> 
<li>In Death series - Author: JD Robb - These books are murder-mystery books. The author also writes romance novels under the pseudonym Nora Roberts.</li>

<ul>
    <li> Key Trilogy</li>
