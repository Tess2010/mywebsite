        <h4><b><i>Recipes I Love</i></b></h4>
        I'm not much of a baker, I leave that to my sister and daughters and I just enjoy the results. I prefer cooking
        meals or making appetizers, especially when we have family get togethers or "girl's" night.
        I thought I'd share a few of my go to recipes when I'm looking to makes something simple but flavorful. Please
        remember that these recipes are made to suit my tastes, you may want to
        adjust the ingredients or add a little something extra for yourself. If you happen to try one, please leave me a
        comment and let me know.
