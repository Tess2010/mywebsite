        <h3><b><i>Recipes I Love</i></b></h3>
        <p id="6">I'm not much of a baker, I leave that to my sister and daughters and I just enjoy the results. I prefer cooking
        meals or making appetizers, especially when we have family get togethers or "girl's" night.
        I thought I'd share a few of my go to recipes when I'm looking to makes something simple but flavorful. Please
        remember that these recipes are made to suit my tastes, you may want to adjust the ingredients or add a little 
        something extra for yourself. If you happen to try one, or have one you'd like to share, please do.

            <ul>
                Ingredients:
                <ul>

                    <li>1 cup of tomato puree</li>
                    <li>1 cup heavy cream or coconut milk</li>
                    <li>chopped boneless chicken (2 breast or 4 thighs)</li>
                </ul>
                Directions:

                <ul>
                    <li>Replace Chicken with Tofu: Firm tofu works well in this recipe. You can press it to remove excess water, 
                    then cube it and cook it in the same way you would cook chicken until it's crispy on the outside.</li>
                    <li>Replace Chicken with Vegetables: You could use a variety of vegetables like cauliflower, mushrooms, or 
                    zucchini. These add texture and flavor, and cook relatively quickly, just like chicken.</li>
                    <li>Replace Chicken with Paneer: If you like Indian-inspired flavors, paneer is a great vegetarian option 
                    that adds richness to the dish.</li>
                    <br>
                </ul>
                    Substitutions for heavy cream/coconut milk:
                <ul>
                    <li>Unsweetened Almond Milk</li>
                    <li>Cashew Cream</li>
                    <li>Soy Cream - Look for varieties labeled as “heavy cream alternatives”.</li>
                    <li>Oat milk  - Look for thse meant for cooking or baking.</li>
                </ul>    
            </ul>
            <br>

    <div class="music">

        <h3><b><i>Music I Enjoy</i></b></h3>
        <p id="8">
            Music has the power to bring people together. It is very spiritual. I listen to music when I'm happy, sad, 
            frustrated, tired, in pain or celebrating something. Music has the ability to cheer me up when I'm sad or 
            let me feel free to cry and release any negative emotions I'm feeling. When I need some inspiration to exercise 
            or energy to complete a task, music gives me motivation. There are so many genres of music to listen to, that 
            it's hard to say which is my favorite. However, there is something about the bass of a song with its low rhythmic 
            beat that calls to me.
